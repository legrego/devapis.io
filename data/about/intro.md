# Welcome to DevAPIs.io!
DevAPIs is a growing suite of free Web APIs for anyone to use.


Our mission is to provide useful tools for developers to bootstrap new projects and enhance existing ones.

## Contributing

### Features and Bugs
All source code for our APIs are freely available on Github. Pull requests are highly encouraged, and all issues should be opened in the respective API repository.
See the API Documentation for links to each repository.

### New APIs
If you have an API that you'd like to "donate" to DevAPIs, drop us a line at todo.


## Prior Art - standing on the shoulders of giants
The DevAPIs suite would not be possible without existing open source initiatives. We would especially like to recognise the following:

| product | details |
| ------- | ------- |
| [date-holidays](https://github.com/commenthol/date-holidays) | npm package by [commenthol](https://github.com/commenthol), which powers the logic within our [Holidays API](/docs/holiday)
